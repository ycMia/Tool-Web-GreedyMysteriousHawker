## Introduction
This is an emergency project for poor ycMia to record his economy footprints and make a log on it.

>If ycMia didn't have done his work on this repository before he archived it 3 weeks after Nov. 27 (2021) , he's gonna die. In order to save his life, please DO NOT BOTHER him while he's contributing to this project, your whole family will have his gratitude.

## Why this?
ycMia needs a completely controlled program and have his hug to the freedom. At least, it's going to diminish his distance to the freedom.
>The explosive is approaching.

## That's Ugly console for users
I do not argue. At least this design will keep being effective for all devices.
